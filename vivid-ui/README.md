# VIVID UI

Yes, I shamelessly used create react app. I think it gives an amazing starting point for developing a new UI react app, and ejecting it is not the end the world if additional configuration is required. It gives a great place to start with sane defaults of webpack, and comes with some nice starter scripts.

Things I like about create react app:

* Quick starting point for webpack
* Includes dev server with proxy capabilities
* Easily handles production builds with minification
* Why do all that other stuff from scratch when you don't need to?
