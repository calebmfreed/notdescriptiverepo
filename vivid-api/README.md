HELLO INTERVIEWER!

The springboot app is no longer hosting the completed UI application. I left the sample project intact, but the completed one is in the folder called `vivid-ui`.

I did this for a few reasons:

1. The dev server you get with create react app is awesome and live updating
2. I didn't want to muddy up the Java code with source and dist folders in strange places since springboot hosts static content out of predefined folders.
3. It seemed easier to split the projects up.
4. If the app ever got any bigger than 1 page, it usually makes sense to split things up.
